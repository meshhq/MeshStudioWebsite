      <description>Authentication and session management are two areas almost all developers have to deal with repeatedly throughout their career. It’s common for us to reach for a well tested open-source library to bolt onto our app, and that’s a good thing since security logic is one of those things you want a lot of eyes on. But as everything in programming, it helps to know the underlying logic behind the tools we use.</description>

      <description>Contiuons Integration with Node.js and CircleCI Software developers tend to come up with complicated names for simple topics.
