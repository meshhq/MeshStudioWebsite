      <description>Building your next web app with Go! Here at Mesh, we like to keep up-to-date with the latest trends in software development; often trying out various programming languages and frameworks. One of the languages that we like to use is Go.

It is also quite a versatile language, so in this post we will explore how it can be used to create an HTML server using gorilla/mux, jteeuwen/go-bindata, and html/template.</description>
