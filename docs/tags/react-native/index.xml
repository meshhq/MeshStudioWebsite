      <description>Drivers Club is a passion project of Doug Perry’s. As a car enthusiasts, he envisioned a community of like-minded individuals where members are offered a full range of services including collection management, curated events, a private lounge and automobile storage — all in a modern, climate controlled, secure, and convenient location.
The first location will be opening this summer in Redmond, WA and a reciprocal club in Scottsdale, AZ.</description>

      <description>React Native navigation code can seem very odd to developers coming from Objective C or Swift. Whereas native code asks that developers subclass Navigation and Tab Bar controllers, React Native demands that app navigation must be scaffolded in a single constructor.

      <description>We are constantly evaluating new technologies and frameworks at Mesh. We do this to ensure that we make the right technology choices for our customers. We do after all, get paid to make these technology choices, so we have an obligation to our customers to make sure our choices are correct.
One of the frameworks that we’ve had our eye on for a while, but hadn’t pulled the trigger with is React Native.</description>
