      <description>You allowed in here? Lately I have noticed quite a few people mixing up the the concepts of Authentication and Authorization. This isn’t a big deal if you’re using them interchangeably when talking about most anything besides tech, but these concepts are quite different and worth explaining.
So, What is the Difference Authentication is simply the notion of identity, but it’s a powerful concept. It’s proving to someone (your local TSA agent), or something (the IRS website) that you are who you say you are.</description>

      <description>Authentication and session management are two areas almost all developers have to deal with repeatedly throughout their career. It’s common for us to reach for a well tested open-source library to bolt onto our app, and that’s a good thing since security logic is one of those things you want a lot of eyes on. But as everything in programming, it helps to know the underlying logic behind the tools we use.</description>

      <description>Contiuons Integration with Node.js and CircleCI Software developers tend to come up with complicated names for simple topics. Examples of this include Dependency Injection, Orthogonality, or [think of something]. While these terms sound impressive, they often produce an adverse side effect; novice developers assume the subjects they are describing are complicated and unapproachable.

The above proved to be true for me when I first learned about Continuous Integration (CI).</description>
