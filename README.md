This is the repository for the Mesh Studio website.

## Developing

#### Site Generation
To simply transpile all of the site code, running:
```
$ hugo
```
Will deposit all final artifacts into the `./public` directory.

#### Site Development
If you would like to develop on the site, it is best to run the server that Hugo provides. To start the development server, run: 
```
$ hugo server
```

The resulting site will be located at `http://localhost:1313`. Hugo server comes with LiveReload support. To enable LiveReload, you need to have the appropriate browser plugin. Please check with your browser's add-on market for the applicable add-on

## Deployment
TBD... not there yet.
