title: Ship Better Software, Faster
sub_title: Weâ€™re Mesh, a Seattle based software development consultancy. We help innovative companies ship incredible software products.
capabilities_statement: We work with companies of all sizes, from Fortune 500s to young, venture-funded startups. We build products across several different platforms and languages.
testimonial: Mesh Studio worked on the most critical parts of our system - they refactored and upgraded the our servers, led an NCC security audit, and wrote an integration test harness that allowed us to significantly increase developer velocity. Mesh also led a migration to AWS with full Dockerization, CI, Terraform, Loadbalancers, KMS, and much more. Most importantly, they were fast, they were humble and were super responsive and I could always rely on them to answer my calls.
