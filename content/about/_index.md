Mesh founders, [Kevin Coleman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-coleman-a3737326/) and [Taylor Halliday](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-halliday-7aa59814/), moved to San Francisco in 2014 to work for different venture-funded startups. Kevin built messaging software for [Layer](https://layer.com/) while Taylor built the future of private transportation for [Chariot](https://www.chariot.com/). 

During their nights and weekends in the winter of 2015, the pair started working on a customer success product called [Mesh](https://meshdata.io/) Data. That product would eventually land them a spot in the prestigious [YCombinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) fellowship accelerator.

While participating in the accelerator, Kevin and Taylor came to realize that the market for customer success products was already fairly saturated. The real problem for companies, however, was that they were having difficulty knitting these platforms together with their own cloud systems. Kevin and Taylor realized that there was a massive shortage of sophisticated cloud engineers who could help companies integrate these services into a cohesive whole. 

As a result, they decided to focus on building a consultancy that would help customers build applications, services, and integrations in the cloud.
